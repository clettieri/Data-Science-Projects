# Cognitive Builder Faire NYC 2017 Hackathon

Using IBM's DSX and the Four Square API we developed an advanced set of neighbhorhood analytics.

Our product will help answer the question of, "what is the best use of this empty lot?"

Here is one of the note books we ussed to build our data product.  This notebook was my contribution to the project.  

It shows calls to the Four Square API, converting the JSON data into useable DataFrames, and two visualizations.  If the
map is not displaying you can run the notebook yourself or render the html file to see it.
